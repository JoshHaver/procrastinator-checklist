# procrastinator-checklist
This is a python command line program that creates a to-do list.
It asks you for your daily meal times, your bedtime and wake time, and 3 daily goals with 3 actionable steps for each goal.
Then, at the end, it provides you with a random reward if you succeed or a punishment if you fail.
